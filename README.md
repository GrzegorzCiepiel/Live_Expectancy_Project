# Live expectancy analyse

## Introduction

In this projekt I analyze data on GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organization and the World Bank to try and identify the relationship between the GDP and life expectancy of six countries.
I use python 3.11 with pandas and matplotlib.pyplot modules.

There are 5 main questions to answer:
+ Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?
+ Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?
+ Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?
+ What is the average life expectancy in these nations?
+ What is the distribution of that life expectancy?

## Analyse

1. Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?

To answer this question I plot a line showing the change of live expectancy over time in every country:

As we can see ***live expectancy increaset*** over time in every country.
